I chose the "pointillism" art style, which composes the image using countless dots or color blocks. 

Because the image we chose for our final project also primarily features circles and has vivid colors with a hand-painted feel, adopting the pointillism style will make the visual impact even more striking.

Moreover, pointillism can enhance the effect of our animation by allowing each dot to undergo small, random variations. Paired with rich colors, the entire image will exhibit a strong sense of breathing.
